## 💡 Key Learnings

**Session Type:**
- This was intentionally a "maintenance day" following Oct 6's 48-commit marathon
- Focus on polish, cleanup, and process improvement rather than new features
- Important to have these consolidation days after major feature work

**CLAUDE.md Improvements:**
- Clear agent operating instructions reduce errors and improve consistency
- Professional communication guidelines help maintain appropriate tone
- Swarm orchestration clarity prevents confusion about MCP vs Task tool roles

**Test Suite Health:**
- Maintaining 0 failures is critical for confidence
- 128 skipped tests are mostly legitimate (slow/server tests)
- ~30-35 skipped tests need refactoring (documented for future work)

## 📝 Next Session Priorities

**Suggested for Oct 9+:**
1. **Test Debt Reduction** - Refactor 25-35 API-changed tests (3-4 hours)
2. **Remove Dead Code** - Delete unused files with 0% coverage (1 hour)
3. **AI Enhancement** - Implement enhanced prompts from plan (2-3 hours)
4. **Issue Tracker** - Create formal ISSUES.md for tracking (30 min)

**Or Alternative:**
- Begin new feature development (AI enhancements, new scene types, etc.)
- Performance optimization work
- Web UI improvements
