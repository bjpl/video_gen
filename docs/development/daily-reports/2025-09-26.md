# Daily Development Report - 2025-09-26

## Summary
Single commit fixing hablas deployment by switching from static fallback to actual Next.js application deployment. This resolved the deployment issues that were being worked on during 2025-09-25.

### Deployment Strategy
- Switched from static HTML fallback to full Next.js deployment
- Proper server-side rendering support
- Correct asset handling for Next.js app

## Solution Details
After multiple attempts at static export deployment on 2025-09-25, the solution was to deploy the actual Next.js application with proper SSR support rather than trying to force a static export. This approach better suits Next.js architecture and resolves path and asset issues.

## Metrics
- **Total Commits**: 1
- **Issue Resolution**: Multi-day deployment problem solved

## Next Steps
- Monitor hablas deployment
