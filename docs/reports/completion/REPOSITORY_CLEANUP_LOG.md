# Repository Cleanup Log - Plan D.5
**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Task:** Archive draft scripts and reduce repository clutter
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Cleanup Analysis

### Files Identified for Cleanup

#### 1. Backup Files (SAFE TO REMOVE)
- `tests/test_input_adapters_integration.py.backup` (14.5 KB)
  - Status: ✅ Superseded by current test file
  - Reason: Backup from migration to compatibility layer (completed Oct 11)
  - Action: DELETE (git-tracked, history preserved)

#### 2. Temporary/Generated Files (SAFE TO REMOVE)
- `profile.stats` (231 KB)
  - Status: ✅ Performance profiling artifact
  - Reason: Generated by pytest/profiler, not needed in repo
  - Action: DELETE and add to .gitignore

#### 3. Python Cache Directories (SAFE TO REMOVE)
- `__pycache__/` directories (15 total, ~452 KB total)
  - Locations: root, app/, scripts/, app/services/, etc.
  - Status: ✅ Compiled bytecode, auto-regenerated
  - Reason: Should not be in version control
  - Action: DELETE and ensure .gitignore has `__pycache__/`

#### 4. Migration Scripts (KEEP BUT MARK AS COMPLETED)
- `scripts/migrate_adapter_imports.py` (285 lines)
  - Status: ⚠️ KEEP - Useful reference for future migrations
  - Reason: Well-documented, reusable pattern
  - Action: Add deprecation notice, move to archive/scripts/

- `scripts/migrate_to_logging.py`
  - Status: ⚠️ KEEP - Migration completed but script is reference
  - Action: Move to archive/scripts/

#### 5. Migration Documentation (RELOCATE)
- `scripts/AUTO_ORCHESTRATOR_README.md` (referenced in DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)
  - Status: ⚠️ RELOCATE - Active documentation
  - Reason: Should be in docs/, not scripts/
  - Action: Move to `docs/guides/AUTO_ORCHESTRATOR_USAGE.md`

- `scripts/LOGGING_MIGRATION_REPORT.md` (referenced in DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)
  - Status: ⚠️ ARCHIVE - Historical record
  - Reason: Migration complete, keep for reference
  - Action: Move to `docs/reports/completion/LOGGING_MIGRATION_REPORT.md`

#### 6. Translation Cache (KEEP - FUNCTIONAL)
- `scripts/.translation_cache/` (empty)
  - Status: ✅ KEEP - Active cache directory
  - Reason: Used by translation service
  - Action: No change

#### 7. Archived Drafts (ALREADY ARCHIVED)
- `archive/scripts/drafts/` (21 files, ~130 KB)
  - Status: ✅ Already properly archived
  - Reason: Historical drafts from Oct 4 development
  - Action: No change needed

- `scripts/drafts/` (empty)
  - Status: ✅ Clean directory
  - Action: No change needed

## Documentation Updates Required

### Files to Update:
1. **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md**
   - Update path: `scripts/AUTO_ORCHESTRATOR_README.md` → `docs/guides/AUTO_ORCHESTRATOR_USAGE.md`
   - Update path: `scripts/LOGGING_MIGRATION_REPORT.md` → `docs/reports/completion/LOGGING_MIGRATION_REPORT.md`

2. **docs/reports/sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-06.md**
   - Update reference to LOGGING_MIGRATION_REPORT.md path

3. **.gitignore**
   - Ensure includes: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `profile.stats`

4. **Daily Log (2025-10-16.md)**
   - Add cleanup summary

## Verification Checklist

Before executing cleanup:
- [x] Verified backup file is superseded by current version
- [x] Confirmed profile.stats is temporary/regeneratable
- [x] Checked __pycache__ is in .gitignore
- [x] Verified migration docs are referenced in index
- [x] Confirmed no active imports of archived scripts
- [x] Identified all files safely deletable vs. relocatable

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW

**Rationale:**
- All deletions are temporary/generated files
- Git history preserves backup file
- Migration scripts being archived, not deleted
- Documentation being relocated, not removed
- All changes are reversible via git

**Safety Measures:**
- Git commit before cleanup
- Verification of references before deletion
- Archive rather than delete uncertain files
- Update documentation to reflect new paths
