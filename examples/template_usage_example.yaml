  objectives_narration: |
    By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to use Git
    effectively for version control in your projects.

  concepts:
    - Repository initialization
    - Staging and committing changes
    - Branch management
    - Remote repositories
  concepts_narration: |
    These core concepts form the foundation of Git workflow.

  examples:
    - git init
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Initial commit"
    - git branch feature-new
    - git checkout feature-new
  example_narration: |
    Let's see these commands in action with practical examples.

  problem_description: |
    You've made changes to multiple files but need to commit them separately.
  problem_narration: |
    This is a common scenario when you want to keep your commits atomic.

  solution_description: |
    Use git add with specific file paths to stage only the changes you want.
  solution_narration: |
    By staging selectively, you maintain clean, focused commits.
  solution_steps:
    - Stage specific files: git add file1.js
    - Review staged changes: git status
    - Commit staged changes: git commit -m "Update file1"
    - Repeat for other files
